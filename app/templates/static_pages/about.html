        <h1 class="fw-bold">About Veritas</h1>
        <p class="lead text-muted">
            Veritas is a data-driven local news analytics platform designed to bring clarity,
            context, and structure to incident-based news reporting.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Mission -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h3 class="fw-semibold">Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
            Local news often reaches readers through a single source or without analytical context,
            making it difficult to assess credibility or understand the broader picture.
            Veritas exists to solve this problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our mission is to help readers <strong>see the full picture</strong> by aggregating multiple
            reports of the same incident and presenting structured insights instead of opinions.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- What Veritas Does -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h3 class="fw-semibold">What Veritas Does</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Aggregates local news articles from multiple independent sources</li>
            <li>Groups related articles into a single tracked incident</li>
            <li>Analyzes incidents using transparent, rule-based logic</li>
            <li>Visualizes credibility, perspective distribution, and patterns</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-muted">
            Veritas does not generate opinions, headlines, or political commentary.
            It focuses entirely on structured analysis.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Analysis Philosophy -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h3 class="fw-semibold">Analysis Philosophy</h3>
        <p>
            Veritas is built on the principle that <strong>analysis should be explainable</strong>.
            Every score and visualization is derived from clearly defined rules.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>No sentiment analysis or opinion mining</li>
            <li>No machine learning black boxes</li>
            <li>No editorial bias or subjective judgments</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Reporting perspectives are classified using predefined source metadata:
            <strong>Public</strong>, <strong>Neutral</strong>, and <strong>Political</strong>.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Credibility & Perspective -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h3 class="fw-semibold">Credibility & Perspective</h3>
        <p>
            Each incident analyzed by Veritas receives a credibility score based on:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Source diversity (40%)</strong> – independent reporting across outlets</li>
            <li><strong>Location clarity (30%)</strong> – clear and consistent geographic information</li>
            <li><strong>Completeness (30%)</strong> – presence of key factual details</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Perspective distribution highlights how coverage is divided among public-focused,
            neutral, and political reporting styles.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Technology -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h3 class="fw-semibold">Technology & Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            Veritas is built as a production-ready web application using modern, maintainable
            architecture principles.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Flask with Blueprint and Factory patterns</li>
            <li>PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM</li>
            <li>Service-layer–driven backend logic</li>
            <li>Bootstrap 5 and Chart.js for visualization</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="text-muted">
            All analysis logic lives on the backend. The frontend is responsible only for
            presentation.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Academic Context -->
    <section class="mb-5">
        <h3 class="fw-semibold">Academic & Design Context</h3>
        <p>
            Veritas is designed as an analysis-focused system rather than a content platform.
            It emphasizes data structures, relational modeling, and rule-based evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project avoids subjective interpretation and is suitable for academic,
            technical, and demonstrative use cases.
        </p>
